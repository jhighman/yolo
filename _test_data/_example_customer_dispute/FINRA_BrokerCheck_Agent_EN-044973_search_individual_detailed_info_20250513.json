THE COMPLAINING CUSTOMER NAMED ALL MEMBERS OF HER BANKING/BROKERAGE TEAM IN HER COMPLAINT.  THE ALLEGED UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE WHILE REGISTRANT WAS TRAVELLING ABROAD ON VACATION.  FURTHER, REGISTRANT IS UNABLE TO ENTER ANY ORDER FOR ANY WFI CUSTOMER BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE WFI ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM.  REGISTRANT BECAME AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WHEN CUSTOMER FIRST COMPLAINED ABOUT IT IN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2008 (APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS AFTER TRADE DATE) AND UPON SAID NOTIFICATION, REGISTRANT PROMPTLY QUESTIONED BROKER THAT PLACED THE ORDER.  AFTER SAID INQUIRY, REGISTRANT IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT.  REGISTRANT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION TO REVERSE THIS TRADE OR COMPENSATE CUSTOMER.  REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT BROKER RESPONSIBLE FOR PLACING THIS TRANSACTION WAS TERMINATED. REGISTRANT ADVISED BY WFI COMPLIANCE THAT THE FIRM DECIDED TO REVERSE SAID TRANSACTION AS A BUSINESS DECISION AT A COST OF $158,825 AND FURTHER UNDERSTANDS THAT BROKER WHO PLACED THIS FNM.T TRADE WAS TERMINATED AS A RESULT OF ADMITTING THAT HE ENTERED THE ORDER WITHOUT OBTAINING DIRECT APPROVAL FROM THE WFI CUSTOMER."
