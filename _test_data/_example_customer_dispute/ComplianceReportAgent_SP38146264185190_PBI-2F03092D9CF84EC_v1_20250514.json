The alleged fraudulent conduct involved an unaffiliated SEC registered investment adviser with whom the Claimants established advisory accounts and purchased investments offered by this adviser.  The Investment Advisor that this claim identified, was subject to a separate regulatory regime under the Investment Advisors Act.  Claimants received the advisors offering materials that related to the investment now being complained of.   Spire was not mentioned in these materials.   The fraudulent conduct,  involving the adviser complained of,  was the subject of an SEC Complaint against the investment adviser and its principal that occurred several years after the former series 7 broker had resigned from Spire.  Arbitration award of $3000000 filed 6/20/2019 for claimants.  Motion to Vacate filed by respondents 7/22/2019."
