          "IN MAY 2008 [CUSTOMER] PURCHASED AN INVESTMENT GRADE BOND.  SHE RECEIVED A PROSPECTUS, CONFIRMATION AND FOUR SUBSEQUENT MONTHLY STATEMENTS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2008 THE CLIENT WAS CONTACTED BY US WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THE BAILOUT OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC.  WHILE OUR OUTBOUND CONFERENCE CALL WAS MADE TO INFORM THE CLIENT HOW THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTED HER INVESTMENT, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE MENTIONED SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE INVESTMENT.  HER PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF A DOZEN AND A HALF INVESTMENTS JUST LIKE THIS ONE OF WHICH SHE AGREED THEY WERE ALL HERS EXCEPT THE ONE THAT JUST WENT DOWN.\r\n\r\nIN AN EFFORT TO PLACATE AND SATISFY THE CLIENT QUICKLY, THE MANAGER, [OTHER FIRM EMPLOYEE] AGREED TO REFUND THE MONEY.\r\n\r\nIT WAS LATER UNCOVERED THAT THE CLIENT SIGNED A PROPOSAL BACK IN 2004.\r\n\r\nIT IS MY OPINION THE NEW MANAGER, ONLY WITH WELLS FARGO ABOUT A YEAR, DID NOT SPEND ENOUGH TIME FOR FULL DISCLOSURE."
