(\"CPI\") and Peter A. Mallouk (collectively, \"Respondents\").   \r\nThe Commission finds that this matter involves violations of the Advisers Act and certain rules thereunder by CPI, a registered investment adviser, that: (i) distributed hundreds of radio advertisements that contained prohibited client testimonials; (ii) failed to enforce the firm's code of ethics (\"Code of Ethics\") with regard to the radio advertisements and the reporting and review of certain securities accounts in which the firm's president had a beneficial interest; (iii) failed to keep true and accurate books and records; and (iv) failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act. Mallouk, the firm's president and majority owner, caused certain of CPI's Code of Ethics violations.  \r\nIn August 2015, CPI engaged a local radio station to air live and pre-recorded radio advertisements regarding CPI through two radio hosts in the Kansas City area. In January 2016, one of the radio hosts became a client of CPI, and shortly thereafter independently began including testimonials regarding his personal experiences with CPI during his live radio endorsements.

CPI did not obtain copies of the live radio spots from August 2015 through October 2017, and did not obtain a copy of the March 2017 pre-recorded radio spot until October 2017.  \r\nIn addition, from July 2013 through November 2015, Mallouk did not report securities holdings and transactions from three personal securities accounts held for the benefit of his family and over which he exercised control to CPI's chief compliance officer (\"CCO\"), in contravention of CPI's Code of Ethics.  \r\nAs a result of the conduct described, CPI willfully violated Sections 204, 204A, and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2(a)(11), 204A-1, 206(4)-1(a)(1), and 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Mallouk caused CPI's violations of Section 204A of the Advisers Act and Rule 204A-1 thereunder.",

(\"CPI\") and Peter A. Mallouk (collectively, \"Respondents\").   \r\nThe Commission finds that this matter involves violations of the Advisers Act and certain rules thereunder by CPI, a registered investment adviser, that: (i) distributed hundreds of radio advertisements that contained prohibited client testimonials; (ii) failed to enforce the firm's code of ethics (\"Code of Ethics\") with regard to the radio advertisements and the reporting and review of certain securities accounts in which the firm's president had a beneficial interest; (iii) failed to keep true and accurate books and records; and (iv) failed to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act. Mallouk, the firm's president and majority owner, caused certain of CPI's Code of Ethics violations.  \r\nIn August 2015, CPI engaged a local radio station to air live and pre-recorded radio advertisements regarding CPI through two radio hosts in the Kansas City area. In January 2016, one of the radio hosts became a client of CPI, and shortly thereafter independently began including testimonials regarding his personal experiences with CPI during his live radio endorsements. The live personal testimonials aired until October 2017. In March 2017, the radio station created a prerecorded spot containing a client testimonial that also aired until October 2017. Although CPI's policies and procedures required the firm to pre-approve and maintain copies of all of its advertisements, CPI did not monitor adequately the live and pre-recorded radio advertisements. CPI did not obtain copies of the live radio spots from August 2015 through October 2017, and did not obtain a copy of the March 2017 pre-recorded radio spot until October 2017.  \r\nIn addition, from July 2013 through November 2015, Mallouk did not report securities holdings and transactions from three personal securities accounts held for the benefit of his family and over which he exercised control to CPI's chief compliance officer (\"CCO\"), in contravention of CPI's Code of Ethics.  \r\nAs a result of the conduct described, CPI willfully violated Sections 204, 204A, and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 204-2(a)(11), 204A-1, 206(4)-1(a)(1), and 206(4)-7 thereunder, and Mallouk caused CPI's violations of Section 204A of the Advisers Act and Rule 204A-1 thereunder.",
