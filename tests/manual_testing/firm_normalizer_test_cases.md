# Firm Normalizer Test Cases

This document contains test cases for the firm normalizer methods in `services/firm_marshaller.py`. These test cases cover various edge cases and scenarios to ensure the normalizer methods handle different response formats and data structures correctly.

## Test Cases

### 1. Standard Firm (CRD 128066)

**Description:** BAKER STREET ADVISORS, LLC - A standard active firm with complete information.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Both FINRA and SEC data should be retrieved and normalized
- Firm name and CRD number should be correctly extracted
- Combined result should include all available fields

**Command:**
```bash
python -c "import json; from services.firm_services import FirmServicesFacade; facade = FirmServicesFacade(); result = facade.search_firm_by_crd('TEST_USER', '128066'); print(json.dumps(result, indent=2) if result else 'No result found')"
```

### 2. Terminated Registration (CRD 39285)

**Description:** A firm with REGISTRATION STATUS terminated.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Registration status should be correctly identified as "Terminated" or similar
- Other firm details should still be normalized correctly
- The system should handle any differences in response format for terminated firms

**Command:**
```bash
python -c "import json; from services.firm_services import FirmServicesFacade; facade = FirmServicesFacade(); result = facade.search_firm_by_crd('TEST_USER', '39285'); print(json.dumps(result, indent=2) if result else 'No result found')"
```

### 3. False Disclosure Flag (CRD 299809)

**Description:** A firm with disclosures flagged as "yes" but none actually reported.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The `has_disclosures` field should reflect the flag value (true)
- The disclosures array should be empty or properly reflect the actual state
- The normalizer should not error when expected disclosure data is missing

**Command:**
```bash
python -c "import json; from services.firm_services import FirmServicesFacade; facade = FirmServicesFacade(); result = facade.search_firm_by_crd('TEST_USER', '299809'); print(json.dumps(result, indent=2) if result else 'No result found')"
```

### 4. Individual with Disclosures (CRD 704815)

**Description:** An individual with actual disclosures (note: this is an individual rather than a firm).

**Expected Behavior:**
- The system should handle individual records appropriately
- Disclosures should be correctly extracted and normalized
- The normalizer should adapt to the different structure of individual records

**Note:** This test requires using a different method since it's an individual rather than a firm.

## Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

2. Run each test command individually and verify the output matches the expected behavior.

3. For any failures, check the logs for detailed error messages:
   ```bash
   cat logs/agents/agents.log
   cat logs/core/core.log
   ```

## Edge Case Handling

The normalizer methods should handle the following edge cases:

1. **Missing Fields:** Some responses may be missing expected fields.
2. **Different Response Formats:** The API may return data in different formats.
3. **JSON String Fields:** Some fields may contain JSON strings that need parsing.
4. **Empty or Null Values:** Fields may be empty, null, or contain unexpected types.
5. **Disclosure Flags vs. Actual Disclosures:** Disclosure flags may not match the actual presence of disclosures.

## Verification Checklist

For each test case, verify:

- [ ] No errors or exceptions are thrown
- [ ] Firm name and CRD number are correctly extracted
- [ ] Registration status is correctly identified
- [ ] Disclosure information is correctly handled
- [ ] All expected fields are present in the result
- [ ] The combined result correctly merges FINRA and SEC data

## Test Results

### 1. Standard Firm (CRD 128066)

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS

The normalizer correctly handled the standard firm case:
- Firm name and CRD number were properly extracted
- Both FINRA and SEC data were retrieved and normalized
- Combined result included all available fields

### 2. Terminated Registration (CRD 39285)

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS

The normalizer correctly handled the terminated firm case:
- Registration status was correctly identified as "INACTIVE"
- `is_sec_registered` was correctly set to `false`
- Registration date showed the termination date (11/30/2020)
- Disclosures were correctly extracted (10 total across different types)
- Sanctions information was included, showing the firm is in receivership

### 3. False Disclosure Flag (CRD 299809)

**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS

The normalizer correctly handled the false disclosure flag case:
- The `iaDisclosureFlag` was set to "Y" in the raw data
- The `disclosures` array was empty, correctly showing no actual disclosures
- Registration status showed the firm is terminated with SEC but is an ERA
- The `is_era_registered` and `is_sec_era_registered` flags were correctly set to `true`

### 4. Individual with Disclosures (CRD 704815)

**Note:** This test requires a different approach since our current implementation focuses on firms rather than individuals. The SEC IAPD API has different endpoints and response formats for individuals vs. firms.

To properly test individual records, we would need to:
1. Create a separate individual normalizer method
2. Update the API agent to support individual searches
3. Modify the service facade to handle individual requests

## Conclusion

The enhanced normalizer methods successfully handle various edge cases for firm data:
- Different registration statuses (active, inactive, terminated)
- Disclosure flags with and without actual disclosures
- Different response formats and nested data structures
- Missing or incomplete data
- JSON string fields that need parsing

These improvements make the system more robust and reliable when dealing with financial regulatory data from different sources.
